This is a Book store CRUD application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to manage books by performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can add new books, view existing books, update book information, and delete books. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and interact with the MongoDB database. The frontend is built with React.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface. This application is an excellent example of using the MERN stack to develop a full-stack web application for managing book inventory.
